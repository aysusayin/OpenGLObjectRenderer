# Object Renderer - OpenGL 
This is a simple OpenGL program which can render objects given with ply files
or it can simply render some objects from its object library such as Utah Teapot.

In the Application.cpp, you will see an object list. Modify that list to
add objects. You can also change animation matrix to create different animations. 

It is also possible to set textures. If you want to set a texture to a specific 
object call "SetTexture" function. 

There are also some camera movements. You can zoom in by pressing “I” and zoom out pressing “O”. 
Also, you can change the view angle using the up and down buttons.
